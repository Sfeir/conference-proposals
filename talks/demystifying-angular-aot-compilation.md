# Demystifying AOT compilation in Angular

## Description

Angular is really fast. Do you know why? One area where the team is continuously pushing the limits is related to
the template compiler. In this talk, we will learn about Angular's template compilation. We will introduce the 
two compilation modes: JIT and AOT. And explain the pros and cons of each mode. More importantly, 
we will demystify the AOT compilation process. 
So, grab some popcorn and join us...
