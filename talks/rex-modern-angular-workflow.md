# Angular Modern Workflow (REX)

## Description

I'd like to expose an exhaustive and modern Angular Workflow.
Through on a return on experience, I'll expose technical solutions, tips and tools.

The topics:

- Angular
- Reactive Programming (RxJS, @ngrx/store)
- PWA (Progressive Web App), Performance, Offline first strategy and tools
- Continuous Integration; Github is (also) a production tool
- Unit Tests (tips & snippets)
- Tools to share and work with Design teams (Photoshop is not Everything)
- Gitflow, (branch and release strategy)
- The JSON-API (specification presentation)
- Linting (Ensure your team sources homogeneity)
- Debugging tools


## Takeaway

In the end you will have learned how to setup a productive Angular workflow.
You team members will hug you.
