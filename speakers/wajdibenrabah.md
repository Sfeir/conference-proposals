## Bio
Wajdi is a Mobile Developer based in Paris and parallel realities (augmented and virtual realities) specialist.
He published articles around these subjects either on blogs or in paper magazines (Programmez! Num198).
He was also speaker in many events (in France and elsewhere).

His main goal is to try to participate in pushing the digital world forward via contributions on Github (Angular2 documentation for example) or via training sessions, workshops, conferences and meetups.
